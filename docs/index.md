# Osmynt Documentation ⚡

> **Secure, Git-powered, Realtime DM for code blocks**

Welcome to the Osmynt documentation! Osmynt is a VS Code extension that brings seamless, secure, end-to-end encrypted code sharing directly into your editor. No context switching, no workflow disruption - just pure developer experience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running with Osmynt in minutes:

1. **[Install Osmynt]({{ '/getting-started/installation' | relative_url }})** - Get the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. **[Set up your account]({{ '/getting-started/authentication' | relative_url }})** - Sign in with GitHub
3. **[Join or create a team]({{ '/getting-started/teams' | relative_url }})** - Start collaborating with your team
4. **[Share your first code]({{ '/getting-started/first-share' | relative_url }})** - Learn the basics of code sharing

## What is Osmynt?

Osmynt solves the frustrating experience of sharing code blocks with your team. Instead of:

- 📧 Emailing code snippets (context gets lost, formatting breaks)
- 💬 Using Slack/Teams (no syntax highlighting, poor readability)  
- 📺 Screen sharing (disrupts workflow, requires scheduling)
- 🔗 Third-party platforms (complex setup, context switching)

**Osmynt brings secure, real-time code sharing directly into your VS Code editor.**
