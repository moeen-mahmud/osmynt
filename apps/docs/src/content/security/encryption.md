# Encryption Details

This document provides technical details about Osmynt's encryption implementation and security measures.

## Encryption Overview

### Encryption Standards

- **AES-256-GCM** for symmetric encryption of shared code
- **RSA-4096** for asymmetric encryption of team keys
- **ECDH-P256** for key exchange between team members
- **SHA-256** for cryptographic hashing
- **PBKDF2** for key derivation

### Encryption Flow

1. **Code Selection**: User selects code to share
2. **Key Generation**: AES-256 key is generated locally
3. **Encryption**: Code is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
4. **Key Exchange**: Team keys are exchanged securely
5. **Transmission**: Encrypted code is transmitted to team members
6. **Decryption**: Team members decrypt using their keys

## Key Management

### Team Keys

- **Team keys are generated** when teams are created
- **RSA-4096 key pairs** are generated for each team
- **Public keys are shared** with all team members
- **Private keys are stored** securely on each device
- **Keys are rotated** when team membership changes

### Device Keys

- **Device keys are generated** when devices are added
- **ECDH-P256 key pairs** are generated for each device
- **Device keys are exchanged** securely with team members
- **Device keys are stored** securely on each device
- **Device keys are revoked** when devices are removed

### Key Exchange

- **Secure key exchange** using ECDH-P256
- **Perfect forward secrecy** - past communications remain secure
- **Key rotation** when team membership changes
- **Key verification** ensures keys are authentic
- **Key storage** in secure key stores

## Encryption Implementation

### Symmetric Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key size**: 256 bits
- **Mode**: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication
- **Randomization**: Cryptographically secure random number generation

### Asymmetric Encryption

- **Algorithm**: RSA-4096
- **Key size**: 4096 bits
- **Padding**: OAEP padding
- **Hash function**: SHA-256
- **Key generation**: Cryptographically secure key generation

### Key Exchange

- **Algorithm**: ECDH-P256
- **Curve**: P-256 (secp256r1)
- **Key size**: 256 bits
- **Key derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- **Iterations**: 100,000 iterations

## Security Measures

### Perfect Forward Secrecy

- **Ephemeral keys** are used for each communication
- **Keys are destroyed** after use
- **Past communications** remain secure even if keys are compromised
- **Key rotation** ensures long-term security

### Authentication

- **Device authentication** using RSA signatures
- **Team authentication** using RSA signatures
- **Message authentication** using HMAC-SHA256
- **Key verification** ensures keys are authentic

### Integrity Protection

- **Message authentication codes** (MAC) for integrity
- **Hash-based authentication** using SHA-256
- **Tamper detection** for all communications
- **Integrity verification** for all data

## Cryptographic Protocols

### Key Exchange Protocol

1. **Device A generates** ECDH key pair
2. **Device A sends** public key to Device B
3. **Device B generates** ECDH key pair
4. **Device B sends** public key to Device A
5. **Both devices compute** shared secret
6. **Shared secret is used** to derive encryption keys

### Encryption Protocol

1. **Code is selected** by user
2. **AES-256 key is generated** locally
3. **Code is encrypted** using AES-256-GCM
4. **Encrypted code is transmitted** to team members
5. **Team members decrypt** using their keys

### Authentication Protocol

1. **Device generates** RSA key pair
2. **Public key is shared** with team members
3. **Private key is stored** securely on device
4. **Messages are signed** using private key
5. **Messages are verified** using public key

## Security Properties

### Confidentiality

- **End-to-end encryption** ensures only authorized users can read code
- **Perfect forward secrecy** ensures past communications remain secure
- **Key rotation** ensures long-term security
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** ensures we cannot read your code

### Integrity

- **Message authentication** ensures messages are not tampered with
- **Hash-based authentication** ensures data integrity
- **Tamper detection** for all communications
- **Integrity verification** for all data

### Availability
