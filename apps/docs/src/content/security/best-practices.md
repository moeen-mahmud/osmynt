5. **Document team changes** - document all team changes

### Team Communication

1. **Share invitation tokens securely** - use encrypted communication
2. **Verify new members** - confirm identity before sharing tokens
3. **Use secure channels** - use encrypted communication channels
4. **Document team procedures** - document team security procedures
5. **Regular security training** - train team members on security

## Code Sharing Security

### What to Share

1. **Share only necessary code** - avoid sharing entire files
2. **Avoid sensitive data** - don't share passwords, API keys, or secrets
3. **Use descriptive titles** - explain what the code does
4. **Include context when needed** - include necessary context for understanding
5. **Regular code reviews** - review shared code for security issues

### What Not to Share

1. **Don't share passwords** - never share passwords or API keys
2. **Don't share secrets** - avoid sharing sensitive configuration
3. **Don't share personal data** - avoid sharing personal information
4. **Don't share proprietary code** - be careful with proprietary code
5. **Don't share large files** - avoid sharing very large code blocks

### Sharing Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate sharing options** - choose the right sharing options
2. **Include context when needed** - include necessary context for understanding
3. **Choose appropriate recipients** - don't spam the entire team
4. **Regular cleanup** - remove old shared items periodically
5. **Monitor sharing activity** - watch for unusual sharing patterns
