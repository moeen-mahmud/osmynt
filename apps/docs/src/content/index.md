# Osmynt Documentation ⚡

> **Secure, Git-powered, Realtime DM for code blocks**

Welcome to the Osmynt documentation! Osmynt is a VS Code extension that brings seamless, secure, end-to-end encrypted code sharing directly into your editor. No context switching, no workflow disruption - just pure developer experience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running with Osmynt in minutes:

## What is Osmynt?

Osmynt solves the frustrating experience of sharing code blocks with your team. Instead of:

- 📧 Emailing code snippets (context gets lost, formatting breaks)
- 💬 Using Slack/Teams (no syntax highlighting, poor readability)  
- 📺 Screen sharing (disrupts workflow, requires scheduling)
- 🔗 Third-party platforms (complex setup, context switching)

**Osmynt brings secure, real-time code sharing directly into your VS Code editor.**
