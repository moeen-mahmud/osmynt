Role	Color / Hex	Why It Works / Use-Case
Neutral Light Shades	#F5F5F5 (very light gray-off white)	Great for backgrounds; lets neon lime pop.
	#E0E0E0 or #CCCCCC	For subtle borders, dividers, disabled states.
Neutral Mid Tones	#444444 / #555555	Darker than mid-gray, lighter than charcoal; for secondary text, icons.
	#2E2E2E	Slightly lighter than your charcoal; useful for cards, panels.
Secondary Accent / Complementary	#0D0EFF (Electric Blue)	Cool contrast with neon lime. Good for highlighting, links.
	#FF1493 (Hot Pink / Deep Magenta)	For sparing use â€” maybe hover effects, error state, bold highlights.
Success / Positive Feedback	#00FF7F (Spring Green) or #4CAF50	Good for success messages, confirmation badges.
Warning / Call-to-Action / Alerts	#FFD700 (Gold / Yellow) or #FFCC00	Attention without being harsh; works well with dark background.
Error / Negative Feedback	#FF3B3B (Bright Red)	For error states, destructive actions. Use sparingly.
Alternative Dark Tone	#0F0F0F	For ultra-dark backgrounds or to differentiate panels.
