## 🎯 The Problem

Software development is inherently collaborative, but sharing code blocks with your team remains a frustrating experience. Traditional methods like:

- 📧 **Emailing code snippets** - Context gets lost, formatting breaks
- 💬 **Slack/Teams messages** - No syntax highlighting, poor readability
- 📺 **Screen sharing** - Disrupts workflow, requires scheduling
- 🔗 **Third-party platforms** - Complex setup, context switching

These approaches break your development flow and hurt productivity. **There has to be a better way.**

## ✨ The Solution

**Osmynt** is a VSCode extension that brings seamless, secure, end-to-end encrypted code sharing directly into your editor. No context switching, no workflow disruption - just pure developer experience.

### Why Osmynt?

- 🎯 **Focused**: Solves one problem exceptionally well - code sharing
- 🔒 **Secure**: End-to-end encryption for all shared code
- ⚡ **Fast**: Real-time sharing without leaving your editor
- 👥 **Team-first**: Built for developer teams, not general collaboration
- 🚀 **Git-powered**: Apply changes directly to your files

## 🚀 Features
