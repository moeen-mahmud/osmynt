# Osmynt - Real-Time Snippet Sharing for VS Code

> 🚨 This extension is still in development and closed beta
> And, the web app is under development and will be available soon 🚨

## The Problem We're Trying to Solve

As a software developer, team work is the go-to way to build software solutions. There's a saying that goes "A delivery of a software solution is a team effort". But, when it comes to sharing code snippets, it's a bit of a hassle. Traditional methods like screen-sharing, emailing or sending code snippets or snippet link over Slack, Microsoft Teams is not efficient. Sometimes, using the third-party collaboration platforms can be cumbersome, unproductive and time-consuming. It disrupts the development workflow and never focuses on the DX (Developer Experience).

## The Solution

This is where **Osmynt** comes in. We addresses these challenges by providing a seamless, integrated solution within the VSCode ecosystem. It focuses on solving only one problem: sharing codes with ease. There are many collaboration tools out there, but Osmynt is different. It helps you to share the codes you need to share. No distractions, no unnecessary features. Just share the code and get the job done. It's that simple. You don't even need to leave your editor 😎

## Features

- **Real-Time Code Sharing**: Share your code snippets in real-time with your team members.
- **Inline Completion**: Get code completion of the received code snippets like the Copilot.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for the shared code snippets in real-time according to the language.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Whether you're pair programming, debugging or maybe doing a trial and error; just share the code or get the code from your team members, make necessary changes and share the code back!!
- **Code Snippet History**: Get the shared code snippets for a session, even if you're not online!
