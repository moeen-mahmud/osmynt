## Project details

This project is a monorepo created with Bun workspace. It has two parts:

1. **apps**: Contains the backend, frontend, and VS Code extension.
2. **packages**: Contains the shared code between the apps (e.g. api client, library, models, etc).

> **Note**: The project is still in the early stage of development. The features mentioned above are in the roadmap. Besides, the project is still growing so it's better not to add any project tree, final features, or any other details that are not developed or planned yet.
